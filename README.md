   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
files.trimTrailingWhitespace: Remove trailing whitespace on save
editor.formatOnSave then Format code on save
editor.codeActionsOnSave: Run code actions e.g., ESLint fixes on save.
3. User Interface Overview:

Activity Bar: Vertical bar on the left for switching between views e.g., Explorer, Search, Debug.
- Side Bar: Area on the left for navigating projects (Explorer), managing extensions, and accessing views
- Editor Group, the Central area where code files are opened and edited
- Status Bar, the Bottom bar displaying information about the current file, project, and system e.g., errors, warnings, Git status

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
The Command Palette is a powerful tool in VS Code that allows users to access numerous features and commands directly with the keyboard. It can be opened by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac). Examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette include configure tasks, change language mode, according to ttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics
5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
According to FreeCodeCamp, Extensions play a crucial role in VS Code, enhancing its functionality and allowing users to customize their coding experience. Users can find extensions in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for specific extensions, and install them with a single click. Essential extensions for web development include: HTML Snippets, CSS, JavaScript e6 etc.
6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
In order to open the integrated terminal in VS Code, press Ctrl+` (backtick) or use the "View" menu and select "Terminal". This will open a terminal panel in the editor, allowing you to run commands and interact with your project. The integrated terminal offers advantages such as ease of use, convenience, and streamlined workflow, as you don't need to switch between VS Code and an external terminal. Additionally, the integrated terminal provides features like syntax highlighting and command history.
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
To create a new file in VS Code, open the Explorer panel, right-click, and select "New File" or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N. To open an existing file, navigate to the file's location in the Explorer and click on it. Users can manage files and folders by renaming, deleting, or moving them within the Explorer. Efficient navigation is possible using the bread crumbs navigation, keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+P (Go to File), and the Explorer's tree view.

2. Then set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
3. Use the debugging features, such as Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out, to navigate through your code and identify issues.
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Initialize a repository: Open VS Code, select the folder you want to use as your repository, and click the "Initialize Repository" button in the Source Control view.
- Make commits: Add files to the staging area using the "+" icon, then enter a commit message and click the "Commit" button.
